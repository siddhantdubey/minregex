# Min Regex

A minimal implementation of Regex in Rust, written by me for me. Just for educational purposes.
I will probably never use this. Built by following along with [this article](https://www.abstractsyntaxseed.com/blog/regex-engine/implementing-a-nfa).

## To-Dos:
- [ ] Grammar
- [ ] Parser
- [ ] Compiler
- [ ] Matcher
